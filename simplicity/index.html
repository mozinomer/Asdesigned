				SIMPLICITY uses the highest quality produce possible and we are setting a new benchmark in cold pressed juicing. Simplicity isn't a 'diet,' latest fad, or a magic pill. It's an approach that's sophisticated in its simplicity: Add in good stuff everyday. This juice is the good stuff, so drink to your health. Each SIMPLICITY bottle has been Cold Pressure Protected for consumer safety, extended shelf life and fresh taste.

			<p>
				Cold Pressure Protection is submerging SIMPLICITY bottles into cold water and then applying pressure to them. The pressure inactivates microbes while retaining the fresh attributes and the nutrients. High Pressure Protection is recognized by the FDA, USDA, Health Canada, the EU and other authoritative bodies for preserving freshness and increasing shelf life without artificial preservatives or high heat. The process leads to the elimination of harmful bacteria while maintaining a higher yield of vitamins, minerals and enzymes, and preserving a fresher taste.
