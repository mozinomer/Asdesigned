					<p class="testimonialContent">I took The Calll Within: Own YOUR Intuitive Process with Meredith was glad that I did. It really helped me get back in touch my own gifts. Then I was able to use my abilities and confidence with them. I thought that taking an intuition class online and having to go through the exercises with people so far away would be intimidating but Meredith kept the atmosphere, fun, playful, and supportive. I surprised myself. When my reads were a little off, Meredith ws able to help me understand why. She’s a great teacher. I met some really good people nad had a lot of fun. I definitley recommend this class.</p>
